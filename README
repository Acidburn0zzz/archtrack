The PKGBUILD files here build pseudo packages that have security tools in
their dependency lists. Over 200 packages are in dependency lists.

Here are the goals in order:
 - Generate PKGBUILDs with tools that already exist in the aur and official
	repositories.
 - Make AUR entries for the packages that do not already exist in any
	repositories.
 - Put together a kernel with security and injection patches.
 - Create a live ISO.
 - Create a menu system of some sort to make things easier for beginners.

This is not the original ArchTrack project. I started this project before I was
aware of ArchTrack's existence. Since ArchTrack appears to be dead, I am
creating an approximately equivalent project with the same name.

If you install these packages with a AUR helper such as yaourt or packer, do not
run the AUR helper as root. These packages have massive dependency lists, making
it nearly impossible to check each depended-on PKGBUILD file for malicious code.
