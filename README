The PKGBUILD files here build pseudo packages that have security tools in
their dependency lists. Over 200 packages are in dependency lists.

To generate the PKGBUILD files from the category lists, run
`generate-pkgbuilds.sh`.

Here are the goals in order:
 - Adopt orphan packages and remove out-of-date dependencies until they are
	updated.
 - Make AUR entries for the packages that do not already exist in any
	repositories.
 - Create a live ISO.
 - Make an unofficial repository.
 - Make voip and rfid categories.
 - Put together a kernel with security and injection patches.
 - Create a menu system of some sort to make things easier for beginners.
 - A website, perhaps.

This is not the original ArchTrack project. I started this project before I was
aware of ArchTrack's existence. Since ArchTrack appears to be dead, I am
creating an approximately equivalent project with the same name.

If you install these packages with a AUR helper such as yaourt or packer, do not
run the AUR helper as root. These packages have massive dependency lists, making
it nearly impossible to check each depended-on PKGBUILD file for malicious code.
