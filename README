Archtrack is able to turn an Arch Linux system into a fully functional
penetration testing system.

There are two ways to install Archtrack.

 - From the Archtrack unofficial user repository.
   Add this to your '/etc/pacman.conf' file:

     [archtrack]
     SigLevel = Optional
     Server = http://tixod.com

   The repository has category groups. Run 'pacman -Sg | grep archtrack-' to see
   them all. The 'archtrack' group contains all of the archtrack packages.

   Note that the tixod.com URL is temporary. We are working on obtaining the
   archtrack.org domain name.

 - From the AUR (see https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/archtrack/)

   If you choose to install Archtrack from the AUR, you may want to use an AUR
   helper such as 'yaourt' or 'packar'.

   If you install these packages with a AUR helper such as yaourt or packer, do
   not run the AUR helper as root. These packages have massive dependency lists,
   making it nearly impossible to check each depended-on PKGBUILD file for
   malicious code.

   Note that installing Archtrack from the AUR can be unreliable.

Here are the goals in order:
 - Make an unofficial repository
 - A website.
 - Adopt all orphan packages and remove out-of-date and broken dependencies
   until they are updated. Post a comment on the package page, sometimes
   providing updated PKGBUILDs, fixes, etc. If a package maintainer does not
   update a package after a month or so, contact them directly. If they don't
   respond, contact the AUR general mailing list.
 - Make AUR entries for the packages that do not already exist in any
   repositories.
 - Create a live ISO.
 - Make voip and rfid categories?
 - Put together a kernel with security and injection patches.
 - Create a menu system of some sort to make things easier for beginners.
 - Make a simple help wrapper that makes it easier to search through man pages,
   html docs, etc.
