Archtrack is able to turn an Arch Linux system into a fully functional
penetration testing system.

There are two ways to install Archtrack.

 - From the Archtrack unofficial user repository.
   Add this to your '/etc/pacman.conf' file:

     [archtrack]
     SigLevel = Optional
     Server = http://tixod.com

   The repository has category groups. Run 'pacman -Sg | grep archtrack-' to see
   them all. The 'archtrack' group contains all of the archtrack packages.

	To install packages from the archtrack repository, use a pacman+AUR wrapper
	such as yaourt. At the moment, many of the archtrack packages depend on
	packages from the AUR. To install everything: 'yaourt -Sy archtrack'.

   Note that the tixod.com URL is temporary. We are working on obtaining the
   archtrack.org domain name.

 - From the AUR (see https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/archtrack/)

   If you choose to install Archtrack from the AUR, you may want to use an AUR
   helper such as 'yaourt' or 'packar'.

   If you install these packages with a AUR helper such as yaourt or packer, do
   not run the AUR helper as root. These packages have massive dependency lists,
   making it nearly impossible to check each depended-on PKGBUILD file for
   malicious code.

   Note that installing Archtrack from the AUR can be unreliable.
