The PKGBUILD files here (will) build pseudo packages that have security tools in
their dependency lists. At the moment, I am working on creating lists of tools
to include.

Here are the goals in order:
 - Generate PKGBUILDs with tools that already exist in the aur and official
	repositories.
 - Make AUR entries for the packages that do not already exist in any
	repositories.
 - Put together a kernel with security and injection patches.
 - Create a live ISO.
 - Create a menu system of some sort to make things easier for beginners.

This is not the original ArchTrack project. I started this project before I was
aware of ArchTrack's existence. Since ArchTrack appears to be dead, I am
creating an approximately equivalent project with the same name.
