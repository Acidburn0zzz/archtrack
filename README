The PKGBUILD files here build pseudo packages that have security tools in
their dependency lists. Over 200 packages are in dependency lists.

To generate the PKGBUILD files from the category lists, run
`make pseudo-package-pkgbuilds`.

Here are the goals in order:
 - Come up with a more expandable package structure.
 - Adopt orphan packages and remove out-of-date dependencies until they are
	updated.
 - Make AUR entries for the packages that do not already exist in any
	repositories.
 - Make an unofficial repository.
 - Create a live ISO.
 - Make voip and rfid categories.
 - Put together a kernel with security and injection patches.
 - Create a menu system of some sort to make things easier for beginners.
 - A website, perhaps.

If you install these packages with a AUR helper such as yaourt or packer, do not
run the AUR helper as root. These packages have massive dependency lists, making
it nearly impossible to check each depended-on PKGBUILD file for malicious code.
