Key:
I   info file
T   tool file

Information we need:
I categories               the package's archtrack categories
  put together from the category lists, put in groups field
I archtrack-package-name   the name of the archtrack package
  directory name. some need renaming (strip -git, -svn, etc)
I description              a description of the package
  already present
I name                     the official/pretty name of the package or primary tool associated with the package
  create manually
I aur-package-name         if applicable, the name of the package on the aur
  directory name
I aur-maintainer           if applicable, the aur maintainer
  taken from the 'Maintainer:' comment or the first 'Contributor:' comment
I status                   describes the status of the package (working, not working)
  this is initially the same as the aur-status
I aur-status               describes the status of the package on the AUR (working, not working)
  generated from the category lists. ones that are commented out are not working
T exec                     how the application is executed
  already existing in the desktop files. the desktop files just need some stripping down and package correlation
T interface                the interface (T,G,TG)
  already existing in the desktop files. just needs a change in format
T tool-description         a description of the tool (is this necessary?)
  we need to create these manually. partially based on the package descriptions

The package directories contain info files, tool files, and PKGBUILD.in files.
The tool files are combined with info files to generate desktop files. PKGBUILD
files for both the AUR and the archtrack repository are generated with the
PKGBUILD.in files and info files.
