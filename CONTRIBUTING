Here are the steps to add a new package:
   1. Create an info file for the package.
   2. If the package is an official repository,
      2.1. Add the '-archtrack' suffix to the end of its name.
      2.2. If the package is a multiplex package (PKGBUILD provides multiple
           Arch packages), add the '-archtrack' suffix to each package
           function.
      2.3. Put the official repo package name in the 'conflicts' field.
      2.4. And in the 'provides' field.
   3. Add the package to Archtrack groups.
   4. Add a comment specifying the package's Archtrack maintainer.
   5. If the package does not already exist on the AUR or in an official
      repository, upload it to the AUR.

Getting information on Archtrack packages:
   In the 'scripts' directory, there is a script called 'list'. This script
   lists packages based on various conditions.
   To get a list of working packages, run 'list w'.
   To get a list of packages we need to find, run 'list t'
   For more information, look at the 'list' source.

Some notes:
   1. The 'packages' directory is a massive congregation of packages. There is no
      orderly structure. Since packages can belong to more than one group, it would
      not make sense to organize them into categories within the 'packages'
      directory. If you disagree, let me know. I'm still rather uncertain about this
      decision.
