Here are the steps to add a new package:
   1. Create an info file for the package.
   2. If the package conflicts with a package in the official repositories, add
      the '-archtrack' suffix to the end of its name.
   3. Add a comment specifying the package's Archtrack maintainer.
   4. Add the package to Archtrack groups.
   5. If the package does not already exist on the AUR, upload it.
   6. If the package is an official package,
      6.1. Put the official repo package name in the 'conflicts' field.
      6.2. And in the 'provides' field.
   7. If the package is a multiplex package (PKGBUILD provides multiple Arch
      packages), add the '-archtrack' suffix to each package function.

Getting information on Archtrack packages:
   In the 'scripts' directory, there is a script called 'list'. This script
   lists packages based on various conditions.
   To get a list of working packages, run 'list w'.
   To get a list of packages we need to find, run 'list t'
   For more information, look at the 'list' source.

Some notes:
   1. The 'packages' directory is a massive congregation of packages. There is no
      orderly structure. Since packages can belong to more than one group, it would
      not make sense to organize them into categories within the 'packages'
      directory. If you disagree, let me know. I'm still rather uncertain about this
      decision.
