  directory name. some need renaming (strip -git, -svn, etc)

  generated from a search of the kali desktop files and backtrack lists
C status                   describes the status of the package (working, not working)
  this is initially the same as the aur-status
C aur-status               describes the status of the package on the AUR (working, not working)
  generated from the category lists. ones that are commented out are not working
T exec                     how the application is executed
  already existing in the desktop files. the desktop files just need some stripping down and package correlation

  already existing in the desktop files. just needs a change in format
T tool-description         a description of the tool (is this necessary?)
  we need to create these manually. partially based on the package descriptions

The package directories contain packages which have PKGBUILDs and tool files.
The tool files are combined with information from the PKGBUILD files to
generate desktop files and AUR PKGBUILD files.
